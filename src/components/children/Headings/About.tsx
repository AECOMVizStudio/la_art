          State Parks has determined that a GPA to the LASHP General Plan is needed to allow for public transit to the LASHP and allow consideration and review of the proposed LA ART public transit use and facility.</p>

          <p className="font-medium pt-4">
            State Parks will gather public input and work with LA Aerial Rapid Transit Technologies, LLC (LA ARTT LLC) to identify and address the potential issues and benefits of the project in order to consider a draft GPA proposal in 2025. Once State Parks determines the GPA meets the required standards and conditions for consideration of action, the GPA would be scheduled for a State Park and Recreation Commission meeting agenda.</p>
          <p className="font-medium pt-4">
          State Parks' GPA process will involve a public outreach effort to gather input to help inform the Department's consideration of the LASHP GPA and the LA ART project.  There will be multiple opportunities for the public to comment and provide input to the proposed action. California State Parks will conduct several public meetings throughout the GPA process to provide information and receive comment and input. </p>
